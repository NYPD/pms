Payment Management System for World of Tanks

Random status update: A full-on wiki will happen in the 1.0.0 release. However, until this project gets public interest and momentum again, the 0.9.0 release will be our final release. In 0.9.0 we will also move our code to Github which currently lives in a subversion server in case anyone wants to do anything with it.

### Update 8/26/2015: 

The latest August API changes brought a bunch of deprecated methods that PMS was using. Since I don't have the time anymore to maintain this, I will be releasing all the changes I have as a 0.8.9 release. I will not be maintaining this project at all for the foreseeable future.
